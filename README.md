NUMBER GUESSING GAME
The "Number Guessing Game" is a fun and easy Java project that allows the user to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. The game involves multiple rounds, limiting the number of attempts, and awarding scores based on the user's performance.

HOW TO PLAY
1. The system generates a random number from a given range, e.g., 1 to 100.
2. The user is prompted to enter their guess in a displayed dialogue box.
3. The computer then informs whether the entered number matches the generated number or if it is higher/lower.
4. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number or exhausts the maximum number of attempts.

FEATURES
1. Randomly generated number within the specified range.
2. Limited number of attempts per round.
3. Multiple rounds of play.
4. Displaying the user's score based on the number of attempts.

HOW TO RUN

-> Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

-> Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, IntelliJ).

-> Locate and run the NumberGuessingGame.java file.

-> The game window will appear, and you can start playing by following the on-screen instructions.

CUSTOMIZE THE GAME

You can customize the game by adjusting the following parameters in the NumberGuessingGame.java file:

1) Modify the range of the generated random number by changing the 'lowerBound' and 'upperBound' in the 'generateRandomNumber'method.
2) Adjust the maximum number of attempts allowed per round by updating the 'maxAttempts' variable in the 'initializeGame' method.
3) Modify the number of rounds to play by changing the condition in the 'if (round < 3)' block in the 'GuessButtonListener' class.
